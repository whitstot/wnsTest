God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit have been transforming my heart since. I have a heart for those who don't yet know Him, and a deep desire to worship Him because of His goodness. In the past, I would use my singing for the glory of myself, but now I see who deserves the praise-- our Creator. If you came to this site, you've seen me showcase some of my artwork and abilities, but I want to point you to Someone better.
